We decided to take a rest after the fight in the dungeon with the Cinder Claws ( cultist ) then Cerris, tried to remember something about this cult. He recalls they are usually followers of Dahak and are boggards, (frog and monkey like people). 

We went down to the dungeons again and instead of going forward to the Archives then we looked into the left most entrance of the 3 tunnels left to explore. In the right most room we find 4 different Sarcofeci with the names of 4 different Hell Knights. On the first one “in honor of Seradelfin” on top of there is a set of bracers. “Master of the blade Renton Vicelly” with a stone on top. “Paravicar Jenesta” with a monkey formed pin ontop. “Paralictor Lorine Senel” with a pair of rings on top. With the plac “Heroes of the order of Nails.” 

The four items are #loot

Gommel found Aleks Signet ring. We will explore the long tunnel that we expect leads to the exit.

We followed the tunnel to the storage room of the pickled ear in Breachhill, there we got caught by the personnel and Roxy told us she had been hiding the secret entrance to the tunnel for Voz the bookseller.

We went to the booksellers shop, found a note pertaining to the Guardian's Way. We headed there, found [[Voz Lirayne]] who turned out to be in kahoots with a female bugbear, a bug and had skeleton minions. We defeated her and are planning on questioning her.
