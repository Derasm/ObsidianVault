Worble ambassador of the Bomblebrashers, representative of the goblins of the citadel.Comes from a tribe of goblins that have lived in the citadel for years. They typically meet with the Chieftain Helba. Worble is sick with worry since the signal fires have been the color of distress signal for the past 2 weeks.

At the town hall, while telling us about all this, a man burst into the town hall, telling us about fire and a fire mephit comes into the room after him and starts setting the town hall on fire. 

We saved everyone from the town hall fire and helped organize the dousing of fire and Gommel and Cerris, Greta Gardenia, leader of the city council, has a look at the mephit after it has been killed.

A guard said he witnessed Calmont summon the creature and set the fire and later race to the citadel.

Worble offers to go with us up to the citadel, and set up a camp outside.  

We approved the citadel from South west, there are 4 entrances. 

Worble tells us she would usually meet chieftain Helba Bomblebrashes outside the keep.   

We went up to the main entrance and found 3 Goblindogs.   

Found 2 insignias of the order of nail, in the lecture room (A6). Darwin and Willow keep one each. Find a list of names. These insignias are sacred symbols of the order and would be valuable for anyone with interest to the order.

In A3 find minor healing potion, 2 flasks of holy water and a wooden shield. Found a bugbear called Silikta, tied her up.   

In A10 we find a knight fighting a mephit in a training ritual circle. We meet Alak Stagram a Hellknight from Vraid in Varicia, he is here on his own quest to find the deed of the citadel Altaerein.   

In A9 Darwin found a Silver sword, a sealed lock box, a manuscript describing the test to become a Hellknight. He hid the sealed lock box and the manuscript from the group but showed them the silver sword but Alak said it would be finders keepers.
